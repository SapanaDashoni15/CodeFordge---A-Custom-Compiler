# CodeFordge 

Welcome to ***CodeForge***, a minimal yet powerful compiler designed for a custom programming language. Built using Flex, Bison, and C.

CodeForge compiles a simplified source language and demonstrates key phases of compilation. It currently supports:

Lexical Analysis using Flex
Parsing using Bison
Semantic Analysis (type checking, symbol tables â€“ WIP)
Intermediate & Assembly Code Generation (planned in future weeks)

The goal is to incrementally build a fully functional compiler while learning core concepts of language design and translation.


<h3> How to Build & Run </h3>
*** Prerequisites ***
<br>
- open your project folder in VS Code and use WSL (Ubuntu) terminal for running commands.
<br> 
- Install : flex and bison

<h3>Build & Run the Lexer (only lexical analysis) </h3>
<br> 

1. flex lexer.l

2. gcc lex.yy.c src/main_lexer.c -o lexer -lfl

3. ./lexer test_input.txt

<h3> Build & Run the Parser (full syntax analysis) </h3>
<br>

1. bison -d parser.y

2. flex lexer.l

3. gcc parser.tab.c lex.yy.c src/main.c -o compiler -lfl

4. ./compiler test_input.txt
